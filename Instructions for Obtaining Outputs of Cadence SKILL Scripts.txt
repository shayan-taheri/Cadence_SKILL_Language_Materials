"Document Title": Instructions for Obtaining Outputs of Cadence SKILL Scripts.

"File Content": This file contains information on how to ...
... obtain the output from a simple script written in
... "Cadence SKILL Language" without accessing Cadence Virtuoso Studio.

"Instructions":

1. Write your desired simple program in the Cadence SKILL Language.

2. Use a converter tool to translate your SKILL program into a common ...
... programming language, like Python.

Example Tool: "https://thepythoncode.com/assistant/code-assistant".

3. Execute the converted code in your preferred integrated development ...
... environment (IDE), for instance, Visual Studio Code to obtain its output.

"Example Code in the Cadence SKILL Language":

(defun hello-world ()
  (println "Hello, World!"))

(hello-world)

"Converted Example Code in the Python Programming Language":

def hello_world():
    """
    This function prints "Hello, World!" when called.
    """
    print("Hello, World!")

# Call the function
hello_world()
